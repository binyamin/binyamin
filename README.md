Shalom, I'm Binyamin

I'm a college student, web developer, and Jew from Baltimore, Maryland. I'd like to expand my network, so please [get in touch](https://github.com/b3u/b3u/issues/new).

:1st_place_medal: I'm proud of [my personal website](https://binyam.in)\
:person_in_manual_wheelchair: I'm working as a lifeguard at [a special-needs camp](https://camphasc.org) this summer\
:no_smoking: I'm being careful with my technology usage.
